# Naila Zaman | U.S. Voter Registration Search Tool

This is a simple application that displays voter registration information by state. A user can use this to view relevant voter registration information for all U.S. states (and District of Colombia).

The frontend was developed in **React.js** using the **Material UI framework**, and the backend was developed in **Python** using the **Flask framework** and **PostgreSQL**.

There is a header in dark blue that states U.S. Voter Registration, some brief instruction subtitle text, and a table displaying 5 rows of state voter registration data." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3c102d-fb5e-4c48-b7e6-2bba76c8dfa3" />

## Engineering Requirements

Please see the following document for the original instructions behind creating this application:
- [SL/VF Technical Take Home Instructions](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/SL-VF-Technical-Take-Home-Instructions)

### Assumptions
1. Full UI/UX wireframes are out of scope for this iteration of the application.
2. Search and filtering is done on a per column basis.
3. Mobile users would most likely use this application for quick online registration information and a CTA. Therefore, only 3 columns are displayed for better performance on mobile: `State`, `Registration Deadline Online`, and `Register Link`.

## AI Output

AI Output can be found in this folder:

- [/ai_reports](/ai_reports)

This folder includes test coverage and optimization reports that were generated by Claude, as well as a `.zip` file containing the Claude logs used on this project.

## Prerequisite Environment Setup

Prior to running this project locally, there are prerequisite steps that need to be completed prior to launching the application to set up the environment. Please reference the below wikis based on your operating system to set up your local environment.

- [Setup Steps - macOS](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-macOS)
- [Setup Steps - Windows](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-Windows)

## Running the Application

Below are steps for running the application on web. Mobile was tested using `Google Chrome > Inspect > Toggle device toolbar`. A refresh may need to be done for changes to go into effect.

#### macOS

1. Ensure the database is running and populated by following the [Docker](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-macOS#docker) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-macOS#postgresql) setup steps.
2. Open a new Terminal window.
3. (Optional) Update [src/config/local_api.json](src/config/local_api.json) with your desired server host and server port. It is recommended to keep the host name in the file and choosing a different port number than `3000`, since that is what the client will be running on.
4. Navigate to the parent directory of the cloned repository and run the following command:
```
./startApplication.sh
```
- This will launch the application in your default browser at `localhost:3000`.
5. Use Ctrl + C in the Terminal window to exit the application.

If you run into issues while running this, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

#### Windows

1. Ensure the database is running and populated by following the [Docker](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-Windows#docker) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-Windows#postgresql) setup steps.
2. Open a new PowerShell window.
3. (Optional) Update [src/config/local_api.json](src/config/local_api.json) with your desired server host and server port. It is recommended to keep the host name and choose a different port number than `3000`, since that is what the client will be running on.
4. Navigate to the parent directory of the cloned repository and run the following command to run the backend service:
```
python3 src/api/route.py
```
5. Open a new PowerShell window.
6. Navigate to the parent directory of the cloned repository and run the following command to run the frontend:
```
npm start
```
- This will launch the application in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
7. Use Ctrl + C in each PowerShell window to exit the application.

If you run into issues while running this, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

### Testing

#### macOS

1. Open a Terminal window and navigate to the parent directory of the cloned repository.
2. **First time only:** Navigate to [src/api](src/api) and run this command (replacing `/absolute/path/to` with your relevant path) so the test file recognizes `route.py` as the primary backend app for backend unit tests:
```
export PYTHONPATH=/absolute/path/to/src/api
```
3. Backend and frontend tests can be run together by running the following command from the parent directory of the cloned repository in a Terminal window:
```
./runTests.sh
```

If you run into issues while running this, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

#### Windows

1. Open a PowerShell window and navigate to the parent directory of the cloned repository.
2. Run the backend tests by running the following command:
```
python -m pytest src/api/tests/test_route.py -v
```
3. Run the frontend tests by running the following command: 
```
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

If you run into issues while running this, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

### Troubleshooting

1. If you notice any Python errors in your console or do not see data populating the table, you may not have the Python virtual machine set up. This is common if you restart. Please follow the [Python (macOS)](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-macOS#python) or [Python (Windows)](https://github.com/nrzaman/take-home-assessment-2025/wiki/Setup-Steps-%E2%80%90-Windows#python) steps to reset and reactivate your virtual environment, and install Python dependencies.
2. Error logs for any backend issues can be found in `src/api/backend-error.log` or `./backend-error.log`. For frontend issues, there are console logs that can be accessed by inspecting the page.

## Future Considerations

### Performance
- Currently, MUI DataGrid is used for sorting and filtering on the frontend. While this works for a small static dataset (like this project), sorting and filtering should be moved to the backend to optimize performance for much larger datasets.

### Features
- A metrics or reporting service could be built adjacent to this application to gather data around user visits and interactions (e.g., device accessed, CTA link clicks, etc.). This would help us make data-based decisions on effective methods of outreach and outcomes.
- Mobile currently only displays 3 columns for efficiency and performance reasons. Another feature would be an option to view the remaining column data in mobile in a different layout, or adding a toggle to the footer to force a Desktop view of the application in mobile.

### Developer Experience / SDLC Considerations
- Develop a standardized branching strategy in conjunction with a PR process to ensure quality and consistency.
- Enforce branch protections.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments (GitHub Actions preferred to keep it within the GitHub ecosystem).
